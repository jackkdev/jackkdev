# Hello, there :wave:

I'm Jack, a 17 year-old programmer from the United States. I mainly focus on low-level systems programming with C and Rust.

## Editors, Languages, and other preferences.

If I'm forced to use any graphical-based editor, I'll usually use any of the assortment of JetBrains IDE's that exist. Otherwise, you'll always see me using Neovim.

My current go-to language for anything is C. It's a simple, light-weight language where I feel completely in control.

My current favorite theme is Gruvbox.
