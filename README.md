# Hello, there :wave:

I'm jackk, a programmer from the United States. I mainly focus on low-level programming with C, C++ and Rust.

## Editors, and other preferences.

I mainly use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), which says a lot about my workflow. Typically, I'll use CMake for anything C/C++ related. If I'm feeling ambitious I'll use Makefiles, but that usually ends in hell.
